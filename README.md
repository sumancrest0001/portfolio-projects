# [Forkify](https://sumancrest0001.github.io/recipe-API/)

> This is an API project where you can search thousands of recipes and get ingredients of each recipe in details. This app also changes the quantity of each ingredient based on number of servings. You can add recipes as your favorites and I used local storage for that. We can also add ingredients into shopping list and remove them if we want.
